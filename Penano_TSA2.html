                    Dear Sentinels Esports Community,
            </p>
            We have an important update regarding our Valorant Esports team roster. After careful consideration and
            evaluation, we have decided to make a change to our lineup.

            Effective immediately, we bid farewell to <font color=red size="5"><strong>TenZ </strong></font> from the Sentinels
            Valorant roster. TenZ has been an integral
            part of our team, and we extend our deepest gratitude for his dedication, passion, and hard work during his
            time with us. His contributions have been invaluable, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
            <p>
                With this change, we are thrilled to announce that<font color=red size="5"><strong> Skitz</strong> </font> will
                be joining the Sentinels Valorant team. He
                brings a wealth of talent, skill, and competitive experience to our roster. We believe his addition will
                further strengthen our team and elevate our performance on the battlefield.

                We are excited about this new chapter for the Sentinels Valorant team and look forward to seeing him
                in
                action alongside our talented players. Please join us in welcoming Skitz to the Sentinels family and
                showing
                him your support as we continue our journey in the world of competitive Valorant.
            </p>
            Thank you for your ongoing support and dedication to the Sentinels Esports organization.
            </p>
