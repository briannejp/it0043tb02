<h1>ANNOUNCEMENT</h1>


<h2>Sentinels Valorant Esports Team Roster Change</h2>

<p>
    Dear Sentinels Esports Community,
</p>
<p>
    We have an important update regarding our Valorant Esports team roster. After careful consideration and
    evaluation, we have decided to make a change to our lineup.

    Effective immediately, we bid farewell to from the Sentinels
    Valorant roster. <span class="tenz">TenZ</span> has been an integral
    part of our team, and we extend our deepest gratitude for his dedication, passion, and hard work during his
    time with us. His contributions have been invaluable, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
</p>
<p>
    With this change, we are thrilled to announce that <span class="skitz">Skitz</span> will
    be joining the Sentinels Valorant team. He
    brings a wealth of talent, skill, and competitive experience to our roster. We believe his addition will
    further strengthen our team and elevate our performance on the battlefield.

    We are excited about this new chapter for the Sentinels Valorant team and look forward to seeing him
    in
    action alongside our talented players. Please join us in welcoming Skitz to the Sentinels family and
    showing
    him your support as we continue our journey in the world of competitive Valorant.
</p>

<p>Thank you for your ongoing support and dedication to the Sentinels Esports organization.</p>

<p class="ty">Sincerely, </p>
